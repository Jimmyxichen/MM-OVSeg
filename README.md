## Abstract
> *Open-vocabulary segmentation enables pixel-level recognition from an open set of textual categories, allowing generalization beyond fixed classes. Despite great potential in remote sensing, progress in this area remains largely limited to clear-sky optical data and struggles under cloudy or haze-contaminated conditions. We present MM-OVSeg, a multimodal Optical–SAR fusion framework for resilient open-vocabulary segmentation under adverse weather conditions. MM-OVSeg leverages the complementary strengths of the two modalities—optical imagery provides rich spectral semantics, while synthetic aperture radar (SAR) offers cloud-penetrating structural cues. To address the cross-modal domain gap and the limited dense prediction capability of current vision–language models, we propose two key designs: a cross-modal unification process for multi-sensor representation alignment, and a dual-encoder fusion module that integrates hierarchical features from multiple vision foundation models for text-aligned multimodal segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MM-OVSeg achieves superior robustness and generalization across diverse cloud conditions.*
